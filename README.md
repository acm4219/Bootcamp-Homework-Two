## Welcome to Homework Two
This Homework is broken into three componentents
1. Make a responsive About Me Page
2. Make a responsive Portfolio Page
3. Make a responsive Contact Page

I was able to make a similar design to the ones that were provided by the instructors that works responsively between viewport sizes for smartphones, tablets and computer screens through the use of Bootstraps columns and rows. 
Each page is linked to the other through the navbar at the top of the page so the user can switch between pages on the fly. The About me Page contains some basic info about me and a picture of myself with links to my Github profile and the Github Pages link to the main page of the homework repository.
